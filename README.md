# SuperiorlySmallPlatformer

Or rather, just the source for it. I do really, really like my art assets. :smirk:

Made for Unity 5.3.4.

Licensed under MIT!

## How can I use this code?

You can't, not without effort, at least. This is simply here to help people with mechanics/design
and things of that sort, i.e. how a player might work, or how a level might work, etc. This isn't
a full scene or Unity project.

That said, *please* feel free to learn from this! Even though it's a little (lot) messy, you could
probably pick some stuff up.

## The game
...can be found under the "releases" tab, in github. Currently in alpha.

### Controls
A/D is Right/Left.

L-Shift is "Dash".

Space is "Jump", you can jump twice.

L-Ctrl is "Crouch", and you can move while crouching.

F is "Interact", which is what you use to go through doors.



If there were platforms, "S" would be to "drop-through", but currently there are none :)
